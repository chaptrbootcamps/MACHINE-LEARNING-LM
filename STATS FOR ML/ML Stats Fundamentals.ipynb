    "## Analyzing Data Distribution\n",
    "A great deal of statistical analysis is based on the way that data values are distributed within the dataset. In this section, we'll explore some statistics that you can use to tell you about the values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "Here we are concern with the middle value. For example, suppose decide to conduct a study into the comparative salaries of people who graduated from the same uni. You might record the results like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name     | Salary      |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| John      | 50,000      |\n",
    "| Joann    | 54,000      |\n",
    "| Shadrach    | 50,000      |\n",

    "Now, some of the former-students may earn a lot, and others may earn less; but what's the salary in the middle of the range of all salaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean\n",
    "A common way to define the central value is to use the *mean*, often called the *average*. This is calculated as the sum of the values in the dataset, divided by the number of observations in the dataset. When the dataset consists of the full population, the mean is represented by the Greek symbol ***&mu;*** (*mu*), and the formula is written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\mu = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}}{N}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "More commonly, when working with a sample, the mean is represented by ***x&#772;*** (*x-bar*), and the formula is written like this (note the lower case letters used to indicate values from a sample):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our list of heights, this can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\bar{x} = \\frac{50000+54000+50000+189000+55000+40000+59000}{7}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is **71,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In technical terminology, ***x&#772;*** is a *statistic* (an estimate based on a sample of data) and ***&mu;*** is a *parameter* (a true value based on the entire population). A lot of the time, the parameters for the full population will be impossible (or at the very least, impractical) to measure; so we use statistics obtained from a representative sample to approximate them. In this case, we can use the sample mean of salary for our selection of surveyed students to try to estimate the actual average salary of all students who graduate from our school.\n",

The range tells us very little about the comparative position of an individual value within the distribution - for example, Frederic scored 57 in his final grade at school; which is a pretty good score (it's more than all but one of his classmates); but this isn't immediately apparent from a score of 57 and range of 90.\r\n",

    "Well, as we've already noticed, Rosie earns significantly more than her former classmates. So much more in fact, that her salary has been identifed as an *outlier*. An outlier is a value that is so far from the center of the distribution compared to other values that it skews the distribution by affecting the mean. There are all sorts of reasons that you might have outliers in your data, including data entry errors, failures in sensors or data-generating equipment, or genuinely anomalous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what should we do about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This really depends on the data, and what you're trying to use it for. In this case, let's assume we're trying to figure out what's a reasonable expectation of salary for a graduate of our school to earn. Ignoring for the moment that we have an extremly small dataset on which to base our judgement, it looks as if Rosie's salary could be either an error (maybe she mis-typed it in the form used to collect data) or a genuine anomaly (maybe she became a professional athelete or some other extremely highly paid job). Either way, it doesn't seem to represent a salary that a typical graduate might earn.\n",

    "We've seen how to understand the *spread* of our data distribution using the range, percentiles, and quartiles; and we've seen the effect of outliers on the distribution. Now it's time to look at how to measure the amount of variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variance\n",
    "Variance is measured as the average of the squared difference from the mean. For a full population, it's indicated by a squared Greek letter *sigma* (***&sigma;<sup>2</sup>***) and calculated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\sigma^{2} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_{i} -\\mu)^{2}}{N}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sample, it's indicated as ***s<sup>2</sup>*** calculated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s^{2} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} -\\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, we sum the difference between the individual data values and the mean and square the result. Then, for a full population we just divide by the number of data items to get the average. When using a sample, we divide by the total number of items **minus 1** to correct for sample bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work this out for our student grades (assuming our data is a sample from the larger student population).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to calculate the mean grade:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\bar{x} = \\frac{50+50+46+95+50+5+57}{7}\\approx 50.43\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can plug that into our formula for the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s^{2} = \\frac{(50-50.43)^{2}+(50-50.43)^{2}+(46-50.43)^{2}+(95-50.43)^{2}+(50-50.43)^{2}+(5-50.43)^{2}+(57-50.43)^{2}}{7-1}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s^{2} = \\frac{0.185+0.185+19.625+1986.485+0.185+2063.885+43.165}{6}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s^{2} = \\frac{4113.715}{6}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s^{2} \\approx 685.619\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the variance, the more spread your data is around the mean.\n",

    "So in a normal (or close to normal) distribution, standard deviation provides a way to evaluate how far from a mean a given range of values falls, allowing us to compare where a particular value lies within the distribution. For example, suppose Rosie tells you she was the highest scoring student among her friends - that doesn't really help us assess how well she scored. She may have scored only a fraction of a point above the second-highest scoring student. Even if we know she was in the top quartile; if we don't know how the rest of the grades are distributed it's still not clear how well she performed compared to her friends.\n",
