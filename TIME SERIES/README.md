### STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
<pre>
Stock Price Prediction means to determine the future value of the stocks or other financial 
instruments of an organisation. If you master the art to predict stock prices, you can earn 
a lot by investing and selling at the right time, 
and you can even earn by mentoring other people who want to explore trading.

You will use the latest dataset that by downloading it from yahoo finance and using it to predict
Google's stock.
The test data will be prices form now till 90 days back. 
Use data from before 90 days back and go 4 years back, that will be your training set.

If you find any problem in downloading the latest dataset you can let the TMs know.

### COVID
<pre>
For this project you will try to predict Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days. 
These types of predictive models help in providing an accurate prediction of epidemics, which is 
essential for obtaining information on the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases.

Governments and other legislative bodies rely on these kinds of machine learning predictive models
and ideas to suggest new policies and assess the effectiveness of applied policies.

### RAINFALL
<pre>
Rainfall Prediction is one of the difficult and uncertain tasks that have a significant impact 
on human society. Timely and accurate forecasting can proactively help reduce human and financial loss. 
This study presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to
create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that
day in major cities in Australia.

Try to predict whether there will be rain at a given place.
